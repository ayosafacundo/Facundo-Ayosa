## Ideas
 
### AyoTech (Stage: Theory)
GregTech meets Idle but it's only a 2D Interface where you get the items and craft the components.

Graphics Motor: ?.  
Design: ToDo  
Features:  
  - Power stages.  

|Short |Full |Maximum Voltage|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|M |Manual |0|
|ULV |Ultra Low Voltage |8|
|LV |Low Voltage |32|
|MV |Medium Voltage |128|
|HV |High Voltage |512|
|EV |Extreme Voltage |2048|
|IV |Insane Voltage |8192|
|LuV |Ludicrous Voltage |32768|
|ZPM |ZPM Voltage |131072|
|UV |Ultimate Voltage |524288|
|UHV* |Highly Ultimate Voltage |2097152|
|UEV* |Extremely Ultimate Voltage |8388608|
|UIV* |Insanely Ultimate Voltage |33554432|
|UMV** |Mega Ultimate Voltage |134217728|
|UXV** |Extended Mega Ultimate Voltage |536870912|
|MAX** |Maximum Voltage |2147483647 |

  - Interface responds to the average power stage of every one of your machines.  
  - Cell like structure for the machines, each cell of distance will add a value of waiting time between processes, decreasing with power tier.
  - You'll need to make every single bit of the machine and craft it all together, and then place it somewhere and link the power, item input and item output.
  - GregTech-like Power generation.
  - Maybe Create-like progression before Energy?
